# Neovim Config

There comes a day in everyone's life when they decide that having to rewrite
their neovim config over and over again is really tedious and boring. There's a
simple solution, and it's making a github repository for it. So, that's what I
did. Here it is.

## Dependencies

This config is built around Neovim 0.9.0+, so make sure to have that. I decided
to have Packer, the plugin manager, bootstrapped so that I don't have to clone
it down manually every time. It just makes everything easier. Aside from that,
there are a few other programs that need to be installed.

- ripgrep (for faster greping)
- fd      (for faster finding)
