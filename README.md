# My Neovim Configuration

There comes a day in everyone's life when they decide that having to rewrite
their neovim config over and over again is really tedious and boring. There's a
simple solution, and it's making a github repository for it. So, that's what I
did. Here it is.

## Dependencies

This config is built around Neovim 0.10.0+, so make sure to have that. I
decided to have Lazy, the plugin manager, bootstrapped so that I don't have to
clone it down manually every time. It just makes everything easier. Aside from
that, make sure to install `ripgrep` for project-wide search via telescope.
